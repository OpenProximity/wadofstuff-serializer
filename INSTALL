To install it, run the following command inside this directory:

    python setup.py install

If you have the Python ``easy_install`` utility available, you can
also type the following to download and install in one step::

   easy_install wadofstuff-django-serializers

Or if you're using ``pip``::

    pip install wadofstuff-django-serializers

Or if you'd prefer you can simply place the included ``wadofstuff``
directory somewhere on your Python path, or symlink to it from
somewhere on your Python path; this is useful if you're working from a
Subversion checkout.

Note that this application requires Python 2.4 or later. You can obtain
 Python from http://www.python.org/.
